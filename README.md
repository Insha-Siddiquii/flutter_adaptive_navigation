# flutter_adaptive_navigation

A new Flutter project in which I give a try to implement an adaptive navigation bar.

## Getting Started

- This project is a very simple demonstration of how you can make your bottom navigation bar adaptive with different
screens sizes.

- In this flutter project, I explore flutter pacakge by material.io [adaptive_navigation](https://pub.dev/packages/adaptive_navigation/example)

## How it looks
